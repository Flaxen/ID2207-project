This program runs using JAVA, thus you will need some version of the JDK to compile and run the necessary files.
To run the main program, compile and run "FullProgram.java"
To run test cases for all other functions, compile and run all other java files. Test cases are located in their main functions and are fully automatic.

The program uses a basic command line menu. Use the command "commands" to view commands. The commands will ask for all needed information.
